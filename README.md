So this went to learning the basic of forms and undestanding the question. I am gonno be honest I had an hard time focusing on this project. it seams my new medication is making it more difficult.

While listening to the presentation while trying to fiure it out on my own. I created an basic website with the forms and recreated the questions from 1.a. As the first questions to take inspiration.

Working more on the questions, i finaly understood we only need to do questions that are interresting.

![alt text](Img/image-2.png)

Questions 1.A as an beginner question and an start for me to work on sounded perfect beginner test for now.

Question 1.B with an function to ignore all other questions in that are part of question 1.B sounded good challage to move further upon.

Question 3.B seems like simular challange to 1.B but looked an little different. Thats why i wanted to work on it.

Question 4.D has most challanging form input for me at the moment. Since it has an fracture and percantile. I want it to respond to each other if one has input.

During the day i also made the website multiple pages and fixed bugs with this issue.
